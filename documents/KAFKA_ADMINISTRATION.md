# Kafka administration

### Overview

Common Components repo includes three components that are used as Kafka stack. Those are:
* Confluent Operator, provided by a chart *confluent-for-kubernetes* from https://packages.confluent.io/helm
* Kafka stack, from repository https://code.europa.eu/simpl/simpl-open/development/common-components/kafka
* Redpanda Console, an open source UI, provided by a chart *console* from https://charts.redpanda.com

Redpanda console serves as an UI to administer the Kafka stack. 

### Kafka configuration

There are a couple options you can set in Kafka deployment. Below you can find a table explaining them:

| Variable name              | Default value | Description     |
| ----------------------     | :-----:       | --------------- |
| kafka.replicas             | 3             | Count of Kafka replicas |
| kafka.topic.replicas       | 2             | Number of requested topic replicas |
| kafka.topic.insyncreplicas | 1             | Number of topic replicas for topic to be shown as in sync |
| kraftController.replicas   | 3             | Count of Kraft Controller replicas |
| kafka.auth.enabled         | true          | Should kafka SASL PLAIN authentication be enabled |
| kafka.topic.autocreate     | false         | Should topics be automatically created if they don't exist |

If kafka.auth.enabled is set as true, you need to have the Secret created in Vault. Secret creation is described in "Secret for Kafka" section in the README.md file. 

### Redpanda Console

#### Console access

You can access the console by going to https url redpanda.*namespaceTag*.*domainSuffix*

For credentials you need to access the Vault, you'll find them in secret named *namespaceTag*-redpanda-credentials.

#### Console overview

After accessing the website above and entering the credentials set up with values, you will see the following screen.
